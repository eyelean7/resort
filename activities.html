      <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
      <p>Enjoy the great outdoors on one of our famous mostly inactive volcanoes! Tired of sharks? Mock them from above. They could never reach you there. Or could they?</p>
      <h3>Fishing</h3>
      <p>Enjoy fishing? Why not try catching the Big Blue, our oldest shark? Over a hundred tourists perished, but may be you'll be the lucku one?<p>
      <h3>Sailing</h3>
      <p>Tired of sharks? There's never enough! Try to outswim then! Chances are you will fail, but wasn't it worth trying?!</p>
